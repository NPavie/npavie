### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nicolas Pavie and i'm currently working for the [Association Valentin HaÃ¼y](https://www.avh.asso.fr/fr) association and the [DAISY Consortium](https://www.daisy.org) as a software engineer. 

Please go check theirs websites and see what we do :)

ðŸ”­ I'm currently participating on 
 - the [Save as Daisy word addin](https://github.com/daisy/word-save-as-daisy), 
 - some text-to-speech adapters modules for the [DAISY pipeline 2](https://github.com/daisy/pipeline)
 - the code maintenance for the [SIDPT Workgroup](https://github.com/SIDPT) projects

### About me

I'm a passionate about IT in general, from low-level processors' architectures to high-level frameworks and APIs.
I had a crush in my youth for Computer Graphics and decided to further explore this domain in my studies, up to a Ph. D. thesis on real-time rendering of surfacic details.

Among my hobbies, i build PCs (when i can, it's a rather expensive hobby).
I also do some system administration and maintenance for friends and relative, and i'm hosting a home server for inhouse streaming and personnal files backup.
