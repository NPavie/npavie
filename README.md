### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nicolas Pavie and i'm currently working for the [BrailleNet.org](https://www.braillenet.org) association and the [DAISY Consortium](https://www.daisy.org) as a software engineer. 

Please go check theirs websites and see what we do :)

I'm a passionate about IT in general, from low level architectures of processors to high level framework and APIs.
I had a crush in my youth for Computer Graphics and decided to further explore this domain in my studies, up to a Ph. D. thesis on real-time rendering.

Among my hobbies, i build PCs (well, when i can ... it's a rather expensive hobby).
I also do some system administration and maintenance for friends and relative, and i'm hosting a home server for inhouse streaming and personnal file backup.
